# HabitLogger

One of the first main projects in the C# academy.

Console based CRUD application to track time spent in a habbit.

# Features

* SQLite database connection

* Console based UI

* CRUD DB functions

* Ability to create and edit multiple habits and then view the entries of each of them

* Ability to delete habits and specific entries inside each habit

# Challenges

- Hadn't used SQLite before so setting it up was a bit of a challenge
- The way to store dates took me a while to figure out, when you send a date in a query programatically to SQLite you *have* to insert the date around single '' quotation marks.
- Still not used to separating things in classes in C# and working with Visual studio in that regard, will have to keep in mind in future projects and then come back to this one to clean it up.

# Lessons learned 

- Got better at DB integration, but got a logn way to go.
- Documentation details and where to find them
